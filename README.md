> Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of May 2018 Project Euler has about 800,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.
